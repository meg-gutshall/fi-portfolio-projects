# JavaScript Project Build Walkthrough Sessions

The JavaScript Project repo has a handful of helpful [READMEs](https://github.com/learn-co-students/js-spa-project-instructions-online-web-sp-000) that outline the requirements for the JavaScript with Rails API Project along with project planning tips and a note about what to expect during your review. There is also this [JavaScript with Rails API Project Setup README](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/mod3-project-week-setup-example) that provides a thorough step-by-step walkthrough to get your project up and running along with some help object-oriented JavaScript refactoring tips. Lastly, we also wanted to outline a suggested flow of execution to aid you in building your project. We put together this "Order of Operations Guide" for organizing and completing your JavaScript with Rails API Project. This guide is based on the 4-part project build study group series.

The application we will create during this series is a "Syllabus Sharing App" for independent study.

**USER STORY: A user should be able to read and create syllabi based on category**
